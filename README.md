**A simple example showing how assembly language can be called from Java using the Java Native Interface (JNI). The native function sums the elements of an array of integers and returns the result as a long.**

# Getting started

#### :heavy_check_mark: Requirements

To compile and run this project, you will need:
- the JDK
- an assembler such as NASM or Yasm
- a compiler such as GCC, Clang or MinGW-w64

The example and build scripts can easily be modified to accommodate other assembler or compiler requirements.

#### :cd: Running the code

Simply use the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/PyvesB/javassembly.git
cd JavAssembly
#Linux x64
./build nasm
#macOS
./build_mac nasm
#Windows
build.bat nasm
java JNIArraySum
```
